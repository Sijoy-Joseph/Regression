Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply various regression techniques to the California Housing dataset, which contains information about different features of houses in California and their respective median prices. By implementing and evaluating different regression algorithms, this project aims to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each model and identify the most suitable one for predicting house prices in California.

Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the California Housing dataset using the fetch_california_housing function from sklearn.
Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
Handle missing values (if any) and perform necessary feature scaling (e.g., standardization).
Explain the preprocessing steps you performed and justify why they are necessary for this dataset.
Regression Algorithm Implementation:

Implement the following regression algorithms:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Provide a brief explanation of how each algorithm works and why it might be suitable for this dataset.
Model Evaluation and Comparison:

Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared Score (RÂ²)
Compare the results of all models and identify:
The best-performing algorithm with justification.
The worst-performing algorithm with reasoning.
